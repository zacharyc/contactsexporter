# Contacts Exporter

This is the beginning of a more complicated project I'm working on to export all my Mac contacts to markdown docs for Obsidian.

This is written in Swift. One of the things I've noticed as I've gone through online documentation is that there is a lot of out of date options for how to do this so I wanted to put together a way that works with the current version of XCode and Swift.
